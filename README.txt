Guild Ops Battle is a turn based 2v2 battle game, created to test and display my current skill level in programming.
Currently the game runs only in the console of an IDE. VScode can also run the program with some tinkering.
This is the second version of the game. It's rewritten from scratch with the goal of having a better structure and
stronger foundation to build upon.
